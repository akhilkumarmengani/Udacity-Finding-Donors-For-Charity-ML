    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Gradient Boosting Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real world application:**\n",
    "- It is widely used when data is often highly imbalanced such as credit card transactions.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Strength:**\n",
    "- Gradient boosting algorithm build trees one at a time, the new tree corrects the error from the previously trained trees.\n",
    "- Identifies the shortcomings of the weak learners by using gradients in the loss function.\n",
    "- It allows us to optimise the user specified cost function.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Weakness:**\n",
    "- Tend to overfitting if the data is noisy\n",
    "- Training time is more since trees are built in additive and sequential order.\n",
    "- Harder to tune.\n",
    "     \n",
    "This Boosting approach takes iterative method to correct the weights from the last classification which decrease the  bias and builds a stable model. Moreover, it works well on the unbalanced data like this where individuals with income > 50k constitute only 24% of the training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     \n",
    "#### 2. Adaboost Algorithm\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Real World Application:**\n",
    "- Adaboost algorithm is used commonly in the Face Detection.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Strength:**\n",
    "- Learns from the mistakes of weak classifiers , and build stronger predictive models.\n",
    "- Uses decision stumnps instead of fully grown trees.\n",
    "- Training time is less.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Weakness:**\n",
    "- Sensitive to noisy data\n",
    "- Should have quality data since the algorithm learns progressively\n",
    "     \n",
    "Since there are less features, the data can be easily formed into decision stumps and combined to update the weights and build a stable model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### 3. Random Forest Algorithm\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Real World Application:**\n",
    "- Forest is widely used in computer vision application like multi-class object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strength:**\n",
    "- RF deals well the data when its noisy or contains missing values.\n",
    "- Easy to tune. Typically, number of features and number of trees are tuned to build a best estimator.\n",
    "- Doesn't overfit.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Weakness:**\n",
    "- Large number of trees can make it slower in real time prediction\n",
    "- If data contains groups of correlated features, then smaller group is preferred which may result in greater random forest error.\n",
    "     \n",

Though Random Forest Classifier has better f-score on training set, Gradient Boosting Algorithm outperformed Random Forest Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier on testing set.\n",
    "- **Prediction/Training time** : Gradient Boosting Algorithm took more time to train the model than other algorithms, but , on the testing set it took less time to predict than other models. This also implies, Gradient Boosting Algorithm yields better performance in the online(real-time) prediction applications.\n",
    "- Though there is not specific method to determine the algorithm suitable for the data, in this problem it is well interpreted by the decision trees. Gradient boosting algorithms begins by training decision tree and then trains the model in a gradual, additive and sequential manner to correct the weight of the observations. So, it performed better than other models.\n",

    "There are two aspects of the Gradient Boosting Algorithm that makes it better than other algorithm 1. Training Techinique, 2. Loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Technique:**\n",
    "- Gradient boosting algorithm trains the model in a additive and sequential manner. This method combines multiple weak classifiers to build a strong model.Decision Trees(or stumps) are used as weak learners. This algorithm begins with a tree and equal weights. Then it corrects the weight from the previous classification.\n",
    "- After evaluating the first tree, we increase the weights of those observations that are difficult to classify and lower the weights for those that are easy to classify.\n",
    "- In 'i'th classification if samples are incorrectly classified, then in the i+1 th classification more weight is added.\n",
    "- The idea is to improve upon the predictions of the previous tree.\n",
    "- Prediction of the final ensemble is the weighted sum of the prediction made by previous models.\n",
    "- We can specify the number of weak learners we wish to use to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Function**\n",
    "- Gradient boosting performs the shortcomings of the weak learners by using gradients in the loss function. Thisloss function is a measure indicating how good are model’s coefficients are at fitting the underlying data.\n",
